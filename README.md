### Code for "Autoregressive flow-based causal  discovery and inference"


This repository contains code to reproduce results presented in "Autoregressive flow-based causal  discovery and inference", presented at the 2nd ICML workshop on Invertible Neural Networks, Normalizing Flows, and Explicit Likelihood Models (2020). 

To reproduce the simulations, run for e.g.:

```
python simulations.py --dataset all --nSims 100 --plot
```
